# Problem 1

First, clean the data in pols-month.csv. Use separate() to break up the
variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day; replace month
number with month name; create a president variable taking values gop
and dem, and remove prez_dem and prez_gop; and remove the day variable.

``` r
pols_month_df =
  read_csv("data/pols-month.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day")) |>
  mutate(month = recode(month, "01" = "January", "02" = "Feburary", "03" = "March", "04" = "April", "05" = "May", "06" = "June", "07" = "July", "08" = "August", "09" = "September", "10" = "October", "11" = "November", "12" = "December")) |> 
  mutate(president = ifelse(prez_gop == 0, "prez_dem", "prez_gop")) |> 
  select(year, month, gov_gop : rep_gop, gov_dem : president)
```

    ## Rows: 822 Columns: 9
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl  (8): prez_gop, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, prez_dem, gov_dem, sen_dem, r...
    ## date (1): mon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Second, clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above.
For consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month,
and organize so that year and month are the leading columns.

``` r
snp_df =
  read_csv("data/snp.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year")) |> 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) |> 
  mutate(year = 2000 + year) |> 
  mutate(month = recode(month, "1" = "January", "2" = "Feburary", "3" = "March", "4" = "April", "5" = "May", "6" = "June", "7" = "July", "8" = "August", "9" = "September", "10" = "October", "11" = "November", "12" = "December")) |> 
  arrange(year, month) |> 
  relocate(year, month) |> 
  select(-day)
```

    ## Rows: 787 Columns: 2
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): date
    ## dbl (1): close
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Third, tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the
previous datasets. This process will involve switching from “wide” to
“long” format; ensuring that key variables have the same name; and
ensuring that key variables take the same values.

``` r
unemployment_df = 
  read_csv("data/unemployment.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment_pct"
  ) |> 
  mutate(month = recode(month, "jan" = "January",  "feb" = "Feburary", "mar" = "March", "apr" = "April", "may" = "May", "jun" = "June", "jul" = "July", "aug" = "August", "sep" = "September", "oct" = "October", "nov" = "November", "dec" = "December"))
```

    ## Rows: 68 Columns: 13
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (13): Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into the result.

``` r
pols_month_df = 
  mutate(pols_month_df, year = as.character(year))

snp_df = 
  mutate(snp_df, year = as.character(year))

unemployment_df = 
  mutate (unemployment_df, year = as.character(year))

pols_month_df_merge = 
  left_join(pols_month_df, snp_df, by = c("year", "month"))

pols_month_df_merge = 
  left_join(pols_month_df, unemployment_df, by = c("year", "month"))
```

Write a short paragraph about these datasets. Explain briefly what each
dataset contained, and describe the resulting dataset.(e.g. give the
dimension, range of years, and names of key variables).

Description:

*pols_month_df*:

1.  this data set is a 822 rows \* 9 cols data set.
2.  the names of variables are year, month, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop,
    gov_dem, sen_dem, rep_dem, president

*snp_df*:

1.  this data set is a 787 rows \* 3 cols data set.
2.  the names of variables are year, month, close

*unemployment_df*:

1.  this data set is a 816 rows \* 3 cols data set.
2.  the names of variables are year, month, unemployment_pct

*Final data set*:

1.  the final data set, pols_month_df_merge, is made up of 3 original
    data sets, which are pols-month.csv, snp.csv, and unemployment.csv.
2.  the range of years contained in the final data set is from 1947 to
    2015.
3.  the final data set is a 822 rows \* 10 cols data set.
4.  the names of variables are year, month, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop,
    gov_dem, sen_dem, rep_dem, president, unemployment_pct.

# problem 2

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

- specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries (rows
  with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using arguments in
  read_excel
- use reasonable variable names
- omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data

The data include a column for the (approximate) number of homes powered.
This calculation is described in the Homes powered note, but not applied
to every row in the dataset. Update the data to include a new
homes_powered variable based on this calculation.

``` r
mr_trash_wheel_df = 
  read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N586") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(year = as.double(year)) |> 
  drop_na(dumpster) |> 
  mutate(homes_powered = (500 * weight_tons)/30)
```

Use the similar process to import, clean, and organize the data for
Professor Trash Wheel

``` r
professor_trash_wheel_df = 
  read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", range = "A2:M108") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(year = as.double(year)) |> 
  drop_na(dumpster) |> 
  mutate(homes_powered = (500 * weight_tons)/30)
```

Use the similar process to import, clean, and organize the data for
Gwynnda

``` r
gwynnda_trash_wheel_df = 
  read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", range = "A2:L157") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  drop_na(dumpster) |> 
  mutate(year = as.double(year)) |> 
  mutate(homes_powered = (500 * weight_tons)/30)
```

Combine these with the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset to produce a single tidy
dataset. To keep track of which Trash Wheel is which, you may need to
add an additional variable to all datasets before combining.

``` r
mr_trash_wheel_df = 
  mutate(mr_trash_wheel_df, type = "mr_trash_wheel")

professor_trash_wheel_df = 
  mutate(professor_trash_wheel_df, type = "professor_trash_wheel")

gwynnda_trash_wheel_df = 
  mutate(gwynnda_trash_wheel_df, type = "gwynnda_trash_wheel")
```

``` r
trash_wheel_df = 
  bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel_df, professor_trash_wheel_df, gwynnda_trash_wheel_df) |> 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

Write a paragraph about these data; you are encouraged to use inline R.
Be sure to note the number of observations in the resulting dataset, and
give examples of key variables. For available data, what was the total
weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel? What was the total
number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021?

  2021 is 1.63^{4}

# problem 3

Import, clean, and tidy the dataset of baseline demographics. Ensure
that sex and APOE4 carrier status are appropriate encoded (i.e. not
numeric), and remove any participants who do not meet the stated
inclusion criteria (i.e. no MCI at baseline).

``` r
mci_baseline = 
  read_csv("data/MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1, col_names = TRUE) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter(current_age < age_at_onset | age_at_onset == ".") |> 
  mutate(sex = recode(sex, "0" = "female", "1" = "male"), apoe4 = recode(apoe4, "0" = "non-carrier", "1" = "carrier"))
```

    ## Rows: 483 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): Age at onset
    ## dbl (5): ID, Current Age, Sex, Education, apoe4
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

- Discuss important steps in the import process and relevant features of
  the dataset.

  - need to skip the first row with `skip = 1` because variable names
    have taken a whole row in the original file.
  - need to use `janitor::clean_names()` to make sure column names are
    all in snake_case format.
  - need to use `filter()` to keep the rows with age_at_onset is of null
    value “.” OR the current_age is smaller than age_at_onset.
  - need to use `recode` to recode the value of the sex column and the
    apoe4 column.

- How many participants were recruited, and of these how many develop
  MCI?

``` r
mci_baseline_original = 
  read_csv("data/MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(sex = recode(sex, "0" = "female", "1" = "male"), apoe4 = recode(apoe4, "0" = "non-carrier", "1" = "carrier"))
```

    ## Rows: 483 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): Age at onset
    ## dbl (5): ID, Current Age, Sex, Education, apoe4
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

- there are 483 participants recruited in the study. Of these
  participants, there are 479 of participants who developed MCI.

- What is the average baseline age?

  - the average baseline age is 65.03

- What proportion of women in the study are APOE4 carriers?

``` r
x_df = filter(mci_baseline, sex == "female")
y_df = filter(mci_baseline, sex == "female" & apoe4 == "carrier")

nrow(y_df) / nrow(x_df)
```

    ## [1] 0.3

- the proportion of women in the study are APOE4 carriers is 0.3.

Similarly, import, clean, and tidy the dataset of longitudinally
observed biomarker values; comment on the steps on the import process
and the features of the dataset.

``` r
mci_amyloid_df = 
  read_csv("data/mci_amyloid.csv", skip = 1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

    ## Rows: 487 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (5): Baseline, Time 2, Time 4, Time 6, Time 8
    ## dbl (1): Study ID
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
mci_amyloid_pivot_df = 
  pivot_longer(
    mci_amyloid_df, time_2 : time_8,
    names_to = "follow_up_time",
    values_to = "amyloid",
    names_prefix = "time_"
  )
```

- comment on the steps on the import process

  - need to skip the first row with `skip = 1` because variable names
    have taken a whole row in the original file.
  - need to use `janitor::clean_names()` to make sure column names are
    all in snake_case format.
  - when using pivot:
    - need to contain all the columns that we want to tidy, which is
      `time_2 : time_8` in this case.
    - need to use `pivot_longer` because we want the data set to go from
      wide format to long format. We want have a single column to
      represent the time variable and another column to represent the
      corresponding values associated with those time.
    - we want to put the time variable which are included in the columns
      names as time_2 ~ time_8 into a separate new column, and name this
      column as “follow_up_time” using `names_to = "follow_up_time"`.
      Then all the values that corresponding to the columns time_2 ~
      time_8 are moved to a new column named “amyloid” using
      `values_to = "amyloid"`.
    - we want to remove the prefix “time\_” for all values in new column
      “follow_up_time” using `names_prefix = "time_"`

- features of the dataset mci_amyloid_pivot_df.

  - there are 4 cols and 1948 rows in the final data set. There are 1948
    observations in the final data set.
  - the variables names are **study_id, baseline, follow_up_time,
    amyloid**
